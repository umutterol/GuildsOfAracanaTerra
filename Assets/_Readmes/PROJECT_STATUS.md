# Project Status: Guilds of Arcana Terra

## Current Progress (as of latest session)

- **ScriptableObject-Driven Architecture:**
  - All character, class, and trait data is managed via ScriptableObjects.
  - `CharacterDefinition` assets are used everywhere for party, guild, and combat systems.
  - All legacy test/debug scripts and old data models (CharacterData, CharacterCard, etc.) have been removed.
  - All systems (PartyManager, PartyUIManager, GuildManager, DungeonRunManager) are fully refactored and up to date.
  - PartyManagementUISetup and all UI logic are now clean and modern.

- **Party Management:**
  - Party selection UI is slot-based and pulls from GuildManager.
  - PartyManager manages the current party using CharacterDefinition assets.

- **Dungeon Flow:**
  - DungeonRunManager handles the full dungeon gameplay loop.
  - Enemy parties and encounters are defined using ScriptableObjects.

- **Traits:**
  - Characters can have multiple traits (as a list of ScriptableObjects).

## ðŸŸ¢ Recent Progress
- Party Selection UI is now complete and validated.
- Players can select and slot guild members into party slots.
- Validation ensures all slots are filled and no duplicate characters are assigned.
- The "Start Dungeon" button triggers party validation and attempts to load the dungeon scene.
- Scene transition is functional; dungeon scene is not yet implemented (expected warning).

## Next Steps / TODO

- **UI Polish:**
  - Finalize and polish the party selection and management UI.
  - Add icons, tooltips, and visual feedback as needed.

- **Gameplay Loop Testing:**
  - Test the full flow: party selection â†’ dungeon run â†’ encounter progression â†’ results screen.
  - Ensure all systems work together seamlessly.

- **Content Expansion:**
  - Add more characters, classes, traits, dungeons, and encounters.
  - Expand the ScriptableObject-driven content pipeline.

- **Documentation:**
  - Update and maintain README.md and this PROJECT_STATUS.md after each major change.
  - Document any new features or systems for future developers and ChatGPT.
